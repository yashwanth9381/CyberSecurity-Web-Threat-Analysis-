## 🔍 Methodology / Analysis Flow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., country codes)  
   - Normalize numerical values  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Traffic distribution by country  
   - Attack patterns by hour/day  
   - Common IPs involved in threats  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Byte ratio calculations  
   - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week)  

4. **Modeling & Detection**  
   - Machine learning models trained to classify traffic  
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

5. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Heatmaps, bar charts, and trend analysis  

---

## 📈 Results & Key Findings  
- Malicious traffic is more frequent during **night hours**.  
- Certain **country codes/IP ranges** dominate attack attempts.  
- Models achieved **XX% accuracy** with balanced precision and recall.  

---

## 🏢 Business Impact / Recommendations  
- Organizations can deploy ML-based threat detection for **real-time alerts**.  
- IP and region-based monitoring helps **strengthen firewalls**.  
- Understanding attack timelines improves **incident response planning**.
