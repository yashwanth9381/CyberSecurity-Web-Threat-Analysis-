Methodology / Analysis Flow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical features (e.g., country codes)

Normalize numerical values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Traffic distribution by country

Attack patterns by hour/day

Common IPs involved in threats

Feature Engineering

Byte ratio calculations

Time-based features (hour of day, day of week)

Modeling & Detection

Machine learning models trained to classify traffic

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization & Insights

Heatmaps, bar charts, and trend analysis

📈 Results & Key Findings

Malicious traffic is more frequent during night hours.

Certain country codes/IP ranges dominate attack attempts.

Models achieved XX% accuracy with balanced precision and recall.

🏢 Business Impact / Recommendations

Organizations can deploy ML-based threat detection for real-time alerts.

IP and region-based monitoring helps strengthen firewalls.

Understanding attack timelines improves incident response planning.
